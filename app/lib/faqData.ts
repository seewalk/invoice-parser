  {
    question: 'What is 3-way matching in invoice processing?',
    answer:
      '3-way matching is an accounts payable control process that verifies invoice accuracy by comparing three documents before payment: (1) Purchase Order (PO) - what was ordered and approved to buy; (2) Receipt/Delivery Note - what was actually received and accepted; (3) Invoice - what the supplier is charging. The system checks that quantities, prices, and totals match across all three documents within acceptable tolerances. If everything matches, the invoice is approved for payment. Discrepancies trigger exception workflows for investigation. 3-way matching prevents overpayment, catches invoicing errors, reduces fraud risk, and ensures you only pay for what was actually received. Automated systems perform 3-way matching in seconds using business rules and thresholds.',

    question: 'What is invoice data extraction?',
    answer:
      'Invoice data extraction is the automated process of identifying and capturing specific data fields from invoice documents using OCR, AI, and machine learning. The system extracts: header data (vendor name, address, invoice number, date, due date, PO number), line item details (product/service description, quantity, unit price, amount, tax), totals (subtotal, tax amount, total), and payment information (bank details, payment terms). Advanced extraction handles: various invoice layouts and formats, tables with multiple columns, handwritten or poor quality text, multi-page invoices, foreign languages and currencies, complex calculations, and nested line items. Extraction accuracy typically reaches 95-99%, with confidence scoring to flag uncertain data for human review. Extracted data is validated against business rules, formatted consistently, and exported to downstream systems in structured formats (JSON, XML, CSV).',

Exception workflows: automatically identify and categorize exceptions, route to appropriate resolver (buyer, AP clerk, manager), provide context and tools for resolution, track resolution time and bottlenecks, learn from resolutions to reduce future exceptions. Goal is to resolve exceptions quickly while maintaining control, using AI to predict and prevent common exceptions.',

Unlike a standard commercial invoice, a proforma invoice is not a demand for payment but rather a quote or commitment to provide products/services at specified prices and terms. Proforma invoices are commonly used in international trade for customs clearance, import/export documentation, letter of credit applications, and advance payment requests. They include similar details to regular invoices (description, quantity, price, delivery terms) but are marked "Proforma Invoice" or "For Customs Purposes Only". Key differences from commercial invoices: not recorded in accounts payable, not legally binding for payment, often followed by a final commercial invoice after delivery. Common uses include: quoting prices to international customers, providing documentation for import permits and customs valuation, securing advance payments before manufacturing, and establishing terms before formal purchase orders. Proforma invoices help buyers prepare for actual costs including duties and taxes.',

    question: 'What is a VAT receipt and how does it differ from a standard receipt?',

      'A VAT receipt (Value Added Tax receipt) is a document that shows the breakdown of VAT charged on goods or services, required for businesses to reclaim VAT from tax authorities. In the UK and EU, VAT receipts must include: seller\'s name and address, VAT registration number, unique receipt number, date of supply, description of goods/services, amount excluding VAT, VAT rate applied (20% standard, 5% reduced, 0% zero-rated), VAT amount, and total including VAT. VAT receipts differ from standard receipts by explicitly separating the VAT component, enabling businesses to claim back VAT on eligible expenses. For purchases over Â£250, additional details are required including buyer\'s name and address. Simplified VAT receipts are allowed for retail transactions under Â£250. Businesses must retain VAT receipts for at least 6 years for HMRC compliance. Digital VAT receipts are acceptable if they contain all required information. Common mistakes include missing VAT numbers, incorrect VAT calculations, or unclear VAT breakdowns, which can result in rejected VAT reclaims during audits.',

Both parties should sign and keep copies. Important: The receipt proves ownership transfer but does not replace official DVLA processes. The seller must complete the V5C logbook section notifying DVLA of the sale, and the buyer must register as the new keeper. For purchases from VAT-registered car dealers, a proper VAT invoice is required. Private sales don\'t include VAT but should clearly state "private sale" on the receipt.',

Used to: request payment from customers, establish payment terms, record accounts receivable, track outstanding debts. Invoice timing: sent before payment is received. RECEIPT - Proof of payment issued after money is received, confirming the transaction is complete. Used to: acknowledge payment received, provide proof of purchase, record accounts receivable, close the transaction. Receipt timing: issued after payment is received. Key differences: (1) Purpose - invoice requests, receipt confirms; (2) Timing - invoice before payment, receipt after payment; (3) Accounting - invoice creates receivable, receipt reduces receivable; (4) Legal Status - invoice is payment demand, receipt is payment evidence. In practice: retail stores often issue receipts immediately (payment at point of sale), while B2B transactions typically involve invoices with payment terms (Net 30) followed by receipts after payment. Some businesses combine both on a single document for immediate payments, marking it "Invoice/Receipt" or "Paid Invoice".',

    answer:
      'Invoice finance (also called invoice factoring or accounts receivable financing) is a funding method where businesses sell their outstanding invoices to a finance company at a discount to access immediate cash flow rather than waiting 30-90 days for customer payment. How it works: (1) Business provides goods/services and issues invoice to customer; (2) Business sells invoice to finance company; (3) Finance company advances 70-90% of invoice value immediately; (4) Customer pays finance company on due date; (5) Finance company releases remaining balance minus fees to business. Types of invoice finance: Invoice Factoring - finance company manages collections and customer relationships; Invoice Discounting - business retains collection responsibility, finance company remains invisible to customers; Selective Invoice Finance - choose which invoices to finance rather than whole ledger. Costs: typically 1-5% of invoice value plus interest (0.5-1.5% monthly on advanced amount). Benefits: immediate cash flow for growth, no debt on balance sheet, covers credit risk, flexible (grows with sales). Ideal for: businesses with 30-90 day payment terms, growing companies needing working capital, seasonal businesses, and companies with large outstanding invoices. Requirements: established trading history, creditworthy customers, minimum turnover (usually Â£50,000-100,000+).',

INVOICE FACTORING - Customers know about arrangement, finance company handles collections, suitable for businesses wanting to outsource credit control, includes bad debt protection options, available to smaller businesses, finance company manages customer communication. How invoice discounting works: (1) Business continues invoicing customers normally; (2) Copies of invoices submitted to finance company; (3) Finance company advances 80-95% of invoice value; (4) Business collects payment from customers; (5) Payments forwarded to finance company; (6) Finance company releases remaining balance minus fees.
