    question: 'What is 3-way matching in invoice processing?',
    answer:
      '3-way matching is an accounts payable control process that verifies invoice accuracy by comparing three documents before payment: (1) Purchase Order (PO) - what was ordered and approved to buy; (2) Receipt/Delivery Note - what was actually received and accepted; (3) Invoice - what the supplier is charging. The system checks that quantities, prices, and totals match across all three documents within acceptable tolerances. If everything matches, the invoice is approved for payment. Discrepancies trigger exception workflows for investigation. 3-way matching prevents overpayment, catches invoicing errors, reduces fraud risk, and ensures you only pay for what was actually received. Automated systems perform 3-way matching in seconds using business rules and thresholds.',

    question: 'What is invoice processing for manufacturing companies?',
    answer:
      'Manufacturing invoice processing manages complex procurement workflows: (1) Direct Material Invoices - raw materials and components with strict 3-way matching against POs and receiving documents; (2) Indirect Procurement - MRO supplies, services, equipment; (3) Multi-Currency - global supplier invoices in various currencies; (4) Complex Line Items - detailed part specifications, lot numbers, serial numbers; (5) Quality Hold - invoices held pending quality inspection clearance. Key requirements include: integration with ERP systems (SAP, Oracle, Dynamics), materials management modules, automated 3-way matching, support for blanket POs and scheduled releases, handling of partial deliveries and invoices, landed cost calculation (freight, duties, insurance), and detailed audit trails for ISO compliance. Advanced features: automatic GL coding based on material categories, approval routing based on project or cost center, supplier performance tracking, and spend analytics by material type.',

    question: 'What is invoice data extraction?',
    answer:
      'Invoice data extraction is the automated process of identifying and capturing specific data fields from invoice documents using OCR, AI, and machine learning. The system extracts: header data (vendor name, address, invoice number, date, due date, PO number), line item details (product/service description, quantity, unit price, amount, tax), totals (subtotal, tax amount, total), and payment information (bank details, payment terms). Advanced extraction handles: various invoice layouts and formats, tables with multiple columns, handwritten or poor quality text, multi-page invoices, foreign languages and currencies, complex calculations, and nested line items. Extraction accuracy typically reaches 95-99%, with confidence scoring to flag uncertain data for human review. Extracted data is validated against business rules, formatted consistently, and exported to downstream systems in structured formats (JSON, XML, CSV).',

    question: 'What is invoice exception handling?',
    answer:
      'Invoice exception handling manages invoices that fail automated processing due to discrepancies or issues. Common exceptions include: (1) Missing PO Number - invoice lacks purchase order reference; (2) Price Variance - invoice price exceeds PO price by threshold; (3) Quantity Mismatch - invoiced quantity differs from received quantity; (4) No PO Match - invoice cannot be matched to purchase order; (5) Missing Receipt - goods not yet marked as received; (6) Duplicate Invoice - invoice number already processed; (7) Low Data Confidence - OCR extraction has low confidence scores. Exception workflows: automatically identify and categorize exceptions, route to appropriate resolver (buyer, AP clerk, manager), provide context and tools for resolution, track resolution time and bottlenecks, learn from resolutions to reduce future exceptions. Goal is to resolve exceptions quickly while maintaining control, using AI to predict and prevent common exceptions.',

    question: 'How does invoice processing handle multiple currencies?',
    answer:
      'Multi-currency invoice processing manages international supplier invoices with: (1) Currency Recognition - automatically detect invoice currency from ISO codes or symbols; (2) Exchange Rate Management - integrate with real-time exchange rate services (XE, OANDA, central banks) or use manually configured rates; (3) Conversion Timing - apply exchange rates at invoice date, payment date, or custom date; (4) Base Currency Posting - convert amounts to company base currency for accounting; (5) Dual Display - show both original and converted amounts; (6) Payment Handling - support payments in original currency or converted amount. Key considerations: exchange rate sources and update frequency, rate variance thresholds, reporting in both currencies, revaluation for open invoices, and compliance with accounting standards (ASC 830, IAS 21). Integration with ERP systems ensures consistent currency handling across procurement, AP, and financial reporting. Benefits include simplified global supplier management and accurate financial consolidation.',

    question: 'What are invoice processing KPIs and metrics?',
    answer:
      'Key Performance Indicators for invoice processing include: (1) Processing Time - average days from invoice receipt to payment; (2) Cost Per Invoice - total AP costs divided by invoice volume; (3) Touchless Processing Rate - percentage of invoices processed without human touch; (4) First-Time Match Rate - percentage matching on first attempt; (5) Exception Rate - percentage requiring manual intervention; (6) Early Payment Discount Capture - percentage and dollar value of discounts captured; (7) Late Payment Rate - percentage of invoices paid after due date; (8) Duplicate Payment Rate - percentage/dollar value of duplicate payments; (9) Supplier Satisfaction - survey scores or dispute rates; (10) Staff Productivity - invoices processed per FTE; (11) Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) - average payment period. Tracking these metrics identifies bottlenecks, quantifies automation ROI, ensures compliance, improves cash flow management, and drives continuous improvement.',

    question: 'How does invoice processing handle recurring invoices?',
    answer:
      'Recurring invoice processing automates regular, predictable invoices from suppliers: (1) Pattern Recognition - AI identifies recurring invoices based on vendor, amount, frequency (monthly utilities, rent, subscriptions); (2) Auto-Approval Rules - configure automatic approval for recurring invoices within expected variance (e.g., Â±10%); (3) Predictive Capture - system anticipates when recurring invoice is due; (4) Exception Detection - flag unusual amounts or dates for review; (5) Contract Matching - validate against service agreements; (6) Auto-Payment Setup - schedule automatic payments for approved recurring invoices. Setup involves: identifying recurring invoice patterns, defining approval rules and variance tolerances, establishing contracts/service agreements for validation, configuring auto-payment preferences. Benefits include: touchless processing for 90%+ of recurring invoices, reduced processing costs, guaranteed on-time payment, freed up staff time, and improved supplier relationships.',
