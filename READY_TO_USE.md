## 🚀 **How It Works Now**

### **Complete Workflow:**
```
1. User uploads invoice IMAGE (JPG, PNG, WEBP)
   ↓
2. File uploads to S3 bucket: invoice-parser-images
   ↓
3. S3 URL generated: https://invoice-parser-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024-10-17/timestamp-filename.jpg
   ↓
4. S3 URL sent to Lambda API: { imageUrl: "https://..." }
   ↓
5. AI extracts data from uploaded image
   ↓
6. JSON data displayed in UI
   ↓
7. User generates professional PDF invoice
   ↓
8. PDF downloads automatically
```

### **Expected Console Output:**
```javascript
// When you upload an image:
"Starting S3 upload for file: invoice.jpg"
"Successfully uploaded to S3: https://invoice-parser-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024-10-17/1729200000000-invoice.jpg"
"Sending to API with S3 URL: { imageUrl: 'https://...' }"
"API Response: { data: {...} }"
"Transformed invoice data: {...}"
```

## 📂 **S3 Bucket Structure**

Your files are being uploaded to:
```
invoice-parser-images/
└── uploads/
    ├── 2024-10-17/
    │   ├── 1729200000000-invoice1.jpg
    │   ├── 1729200001234-receipt2.png
    │   └── 1729200002345-bill3.webp
    └── 2024-10-18/
        └── 1729286400000-invoice4.jpg
```

**Check your S3 bucket:**
- Console: https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com
- Bucket: `invoice-parser-images`
- Region: `eu-west-2` (London)

---

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### **If upload fails:**

1. **Check Console for Errors:**
   ```javascript
   // Look for error messages:
   "S3 upload failed: AccessDenied"
   "Failed to upload to S3: ..."
   ```

2. **Verify IAM Permissions:**
   - Go to AWS IAM Console
   - Check user: Has S3 PutObject permission?
   - Check bucket: Has correct permissions?

3. **Check CORS Configuration:**
   - Go to S3 bucket → Permissions → CORS
   - Should allow POST, PUT from all origins
   - See `AWS_S3_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for config

4. **Restart Dev Server:**
   ```bash
   # Stop and restart to reload .env.local
   cd /home/user/webapp
   npm run dev
   ```

### **If API processing fails:**

1. **Check S3 URL:**
   - Console should show: "Sending to API with S3 URL: ..."
   - URL should be: `https://invoice-parser-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/...`
   - Not the test URL: `fakeinvoice2.jpg`

2. **Verify Lambda Permissions:**
   - Lambda needs to read from S3
   - Check Lambda execution role
   - Should have S3 GetObject permission

3. **Check API Gateway:**
   - Endpoint should be accessible
   - CORS should allow requests
   - Check CloudWatch logs
