- ✅ `ParserProcessingSteps.tsx` - Step visualization (client)
- ✅ `ParserResultsDisplay.tsx` - Results table (client + memo)
- ✅ `ParserActions.tsx` - Export buttons (client)
- ✅ Server actions for S3/processing (moves AWS SDK to server)

**Expected Gain:**
- ⚡ 40-60% faster initial load
- 💰 Higher demo completion rate = more signups
- 📊 Better LCP score (Core Web Vital)

---

### 2. **Invoice Template Detail Page (656 lines) - REVENUE DRIVER**
**File:** `app/invoice-templates/[slug]/page.tsx`
**Problem:** Large component, lots of inline preview rendering
**Impact:** These pages drive template downloads = SEO traffic = revenue
**Priority:** 🔴 HIGH

**Split into:**
- ✅ `TemplatePreview.tsx` - Invoice preview (client + memo)
- ✅ `TemplateFeaturesList.tsx` - Features section (server)
- ✅ `TemplateDownloadSection.tsx` - Download CTA (client)

**Impact:** This is where people land = need instant load
**Priority:** 🔴 HIGH

**Optimize:**
- ✅ Lazy load sections below fold (ROI, Testimonials)
- ✅ Move schema markup to metadata
- ✅ Defer non-critical animations
- ✅ Use dynamic imports for heavy components

**Expected Gain:**
- ⚡ 50%+ faster initial paint

---

## 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY - Quick Wins

### 4. **Invoice Templates Landing (495 lines)**
**File:** `app/invoice-templates/page.tsx`
**Problem:** Rendering all templates at once
**Solution:**
- ✅ Paginate or virtualize template grid

- ✅ Extract `TemplateCard` and `IndustrySection` to separate files

**Expected Gain:** 25-35% faster load, better mobile performance

---

### 5. **SEO Preview Component (424 lines)**
**File:** `app/components/seo/SEOPreview.tsx`
**Problem:** Large client component for admin feature
**Solution:**
- ✅ Code split - only load when needed

**Expected Gain:** Better hydration, faster search

---

## 🟢 MEDIUM PRIORITY - Refactoring

### 7. **Shared Components - Bundle Optimization**
**Files:** All components in `app/components/`
**Strategy:**

#### Footer (318 lines)
- Extract `FooterSection.tsx` - Reusable section
- Extract `FooterLinks.tsx` - Link groups
- Extract `FooterNewsletter.tsx` - Newsletter form

#### Navigation (146 lines)
- Already client component
- Consider memoizing menu items
- Add intersection observer for scroll effects

#### Large Client Components (100+ lines each)
- `PricingSection.tsx` (188 lines) → Extract pricing cards
- `ROISection.tsx` (124 lines) → Extract calculator logic
- `TestimonialsSection.tsx` (118 lines) → Extract testimonial cards
- `HowItWorksSection.tsx` (115 lines) → Extract step cards
- `DemoVisualization.tsx` (113 lines) → Lazy load animations

**Expected Gain:** 
- Better code splitting
- Reusable components across pages
- Easier maintenance

## 📊 TECHNICAL ANALYSIS

### Current Bundle Concerns:
```
🔴 CRITICAL IMPORTS (Heavy Libraries):
- jsPDF + autotable (~150KB)
- @aws-sdk/client-s3 (~300KB)
- framer-motion (already used, ~100KB)
- lucide-react (tree-shakeable, OK)

🟡 CLIENT COMPONENTS: 18 files
- Many could be server components
- Some could be lazy loaded
- Memo candidates: Cards, lists, forms
```

### Performance Opportunities:

#### 1. **Code Splitting Strategy**
```javascript
// Instead of:
import InvoiceGeneratorClient from './components/InvoiceGeneratorClient'

// Use:
const InvoiceGeneratorClient = dynamic(
  () => import('./components/InvoiceGeneratorClient'),
  { loading: () => <Spinner />, ssr: false }
)
```

#### 2. **Server vs Client Components**
```
✅ Server Components (Static):
- Template lists
- Feature grids
- Testimonials (static)
- FAQ content
- Blog articles

🔄 Client Components (Interactive):
- Forms (upload, search, filters)
- Animations (framer-motion)
- Modals/Dropdowns
- File processing
```

#### 3. **React.memo Candidates**
- Template cards (prevent re-render on filter)
- FAQ items (prevent re-render on search)
- Pricing cards (static data)
- Testimonial cards (static data)
