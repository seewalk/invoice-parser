## 🎯 Strategic Approach Achieved

### ✅ "Calm Monetization" Philosophy
- **Non-blocking:** Users always get their PDF first
- **Dismissible:** Modal can be closed anytime
- **Clear options:** Two tiers clearly explained
- **No dark patterns:** Transparent, honest, respectful
- **User control:** "Maybe Later" always available

### ✅ Two-Tier Entry Points
- **Low barrier:** £9.99 one-time (impulse purchase)
- **High value:** £29/mo subscription (better ROI)
- **Natural upgrade:** One-time buyers see subscription value

### ✅ Visibility Without Overwhelm
- **Pricing on cards:** Users know costs upfront
- **Post-download prompt:** After value demonstrated
- **2-second delay:** Not aggressive
- **"Coming Soon" buttons:** Clear expectation setting

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Dynamic Imports (Performance)
```typescript
const UpgradePrompt = dynamic(
  () => import('@/app/components/monetization/UpgradePrompt'),
  { ssr: false }
);
```

### State Management
```typescript
const [showUpgradePrompt, setShowUpgradePrompt] = useState(false);

// Show 2 seconds after download
setTimeout(() => {
  setShowUpgradePrompt(true);
}, 2000);
```

### Type Safety
```typescript
import { PRICING_CONSTANTS } from '@/app/types/pricing';

// Usage
£{PRICING_CONSTANTS.TEMPLATE_PRICE} // £9.99
£{PRICING_CONSTANTS.PROFESSIONAL_MONTHLY} // £29
```

### Reusability
```typescript
<UpgradePrompt
  isOpen={showUpgradePrompt}
  onClose={() => setShowUpgradePrompt(false)}
  source="template-download" // or "invoice-generator" or "parser"
  templateName={template.name}
  templateId={template.id}
/>
```
