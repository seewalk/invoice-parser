## 🎯 Top 3 Actions to Take Right Now

### 1. Fix Pages Scoring Under 60
Look for this in the report:
```
[45/100] /uk-invoice-guides/some-page
  Issues:
    ❌ CRITICAL: No H1 tag found
    ❌ Very thin content (280 words)
```

**Fix:**
- Add an H1 with primary keyword
- Expand content to 800+ words
- Add H2 section headings

---

### 2. Optimize Titles with Low Keyword Scores
Look for:
```
🎯 Top Keyword: "vat invoice" (2 mentions, 0.3% density)
  ❌ Missing from title
  ❌ Missing from H1
```

**Fix:**
```tsx
// Before
title: 'Invoice Guide'

// After
title: 'VAT Invoice Guide: Complete UK Compliance | Elektroluma'
```

### 3. Expand Thin Content
Look for:
```
📏 Words: 450 | H1: 1 | H2: 1
  ⚠️  Thin content (450 words) - aim for 800+
```

**Fix:**
- Add detailed explanations
- Include examples and case studies
- Add FAQ section (great for long-tail keywords!)
