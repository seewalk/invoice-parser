## üö® WHAT YOU NEED TO DO RIGHT NOW

### The Problem

You're getting this error:
```
SignatureDoesNotMatch: The request signature we calculated does not match 
the signature you provided. Check your key and signing method.
```

**This is a BACKEND issue** - The server action is working, but your AWS credentials aren't configured correctly.

### The Solution (5 Minutes)

#### Step 1: Open Your .env.local File

**Location:** `C:\Users\paula\invoice-parser\.env.local`

#### Step 2: Update AWS Variables (Remove NEXT_PUBLIC_ Prefix)

**‚ùå CHANGE FROM THIS (WRONG):**
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOUR_KEY_HERE
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_HERE
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_REGION=eu-west-2
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_S3_BUCKET=invoice-parser-images
```

**‚úÖ TO THIS (CORRECT):**
```env
# AWS S3 Configuration (SERVER-SIDE ONLY - NO NEXT_PUBLIC_!)
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOUR_KEY_HERE
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_HERE
AWS_REGION=eu-west-2
AWS_S3_BUCKET=invoice-parser-images

# API stays public (keep NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_ENDPOINT=https://jm1n4qxu69.execute-api.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/invoicer-stage/invoiceParser
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** Replace `YOUR_KEY_HERE` and `YOUR_SECRET_HERE` with your actual AWS credentials!

#### Step 3: ‚ö†Ô∏è Check Your AWS Secret Key Length

Your current secret key appears to be **41 characters**, but AWS Secret Access Keys are ALWAYS exactly **40 characters**.

**This means your key is probably incorrect!**

**How to get a fresh key:**

1. Go to AWS Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/
2. Click **Users** ‚Üí Your User ‚Üí **Security Credentials**
3. Click **Create Access Key**
4. Download the CSV or copy BOTH keys carefully
5. Paste into your `.env.local` (both Access Key ID and Secret Access Key)

**Expected lengths:**
- Access Key ID: **Exactly 20 characters** (starts with AKIA)
- Secret Access Key: **Exactly 40 characters**

#### Step 4: Restart Your Dev Server

**CRITICAL:** Changes to `.env.local` only take effect after restarting!

```bash
# In your terminal running npm run dev:
# 1. Press Ctrl+C to stop
# 2. Wait for it to fully stop
# 3. Start again:
npm run dev
```

#### Step 5: Test and Check Debug Logs

1. Open http://localhost:3000/parser
2. Upload an invoice image
3. Click "Process Invoice"
4. **Check your terminal for this output:**

```
[S3 Upload] Environment check: {
  hasAccessKey: true,      ‚Üê Should be true
  hasSecretKey: true,      ‚Üê Should be true
  accessKeyLength: 20,     ‚Üê Should be exactly 20
  secretKeyLength: 40,     ‚Üê Should be exactly 40
  region: 'eu-west-2',
  bucket: 'invoice-parser-images'
}
```

---

## üéØ What Each Log Value Means

### ‚úÖ Success Pattern (What you want to see)
```
hasAccessKey: true
hasSecretKey: true
accessKeyLength: 20
secretKeyLength: 40
```
‚Üí **Credentials are loading correctly!**

If you still get SignatureDoesNotMatch with these values, the keys themselves are wrong. Get fresh keys from AWS Console.

### ‚ùå Environment Variables Not Loading
```
hasAccessKey: false
hasSecretKey: false
accessKeyLength: 0
secretKeyLength: 0
```
‚Üí **You didn't remove NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix, or didn't restart server**

**Fix:** Check `.env.local` again, restart server completely.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Malformed Keys
```
accessKeyLength: 19  (or anything other than 20)
secretKeyLength: 41  (or anything other than 40)
```
‚Üí **Keys are incomplete or have extra characters**

**Fix:** Get fresh keys from AWS Console, copy carefully.

---

## üîç Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. ‚ùå **Leaving NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix**
   - Server looks for `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, not `NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
   - Without removing this, server gets `undefined` and uses fallback

2. ‚ùå **Not restarting dev server**
   - `.env.local` changes ONLY load on startup
   - Must do full stop (Ctrl+C) then start again

3. ‚ùå **Adding spaces around equals**
   - ‚úÖ Correct: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=abc123`
   - ‚ùå Wrong: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = abc123`

4. ‚ùå **Incomplete key copy from AWS Console**
   - Always download the CSV file or copy the full key
   - Secret keys are 40 chars - if yours is 41, you have an extra character

5. ‚ùå **Using quotes in .env.local**
   - ‚úÖ Correct: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=abc123`
   - ‚ùå Wrong: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="abc123"`

## üß™ Testing Without AWS (Optional)

If you want to test the parser while you fix AWS:

**The server action automatically falls back to a demo image when credentials aren't configured.**

You'll see this in the console:
```
[S3 Upload] AWS credentials not configured, using fallback image
```

This lets you test everything else (OCR, parsing, results display) without working AWS credentials.

## üìã Quick Checklist

Before you report back, make sure you've done ALL of these:

- [ ] Opened `C:\Users\paula\invoice-parser\.env.local`
- [ ] Removed `NEXT_PUBLIC_` from ALL AWS variables (except API_ENDPOINT)
- [ ] Verified your AWS Secret Key is exactly 40 characters
- [ ] Got fresh AWS keys if your secret was 41 characters
- [ ] Saved the `.env.local` file
- [ ] **Fully stopped the dev server** (Ctrl+C)
- [ ] **Restarted the dev server** (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] Tested upload on http://localhost:3000/parser
- [ ] **Checked the terminal output** for `[S3 Upload] Environment check:`

---

## üìû What to Report Back

After following ALL steps above, please share:

1. **The debug log output** from your terminal:
   ```
   [S3 Upload] Environment check: { ... }
   ```

2. **Does it still error?** If yes, what's the exact error message?

3. **Credential lengths from the log:**
   - accessKeyLength: ?
   - secretKeyLength: ?

This will help me diagnose whether the issue is:
- Environment variables not loading
- Keys are malformed
- Keys are correct but lack IAM permissions
- Something else

## üéâ Expected Result After Fix

When everything is working:

‚úÖ No more SignatureDoesNotMatch error
‚úÖ Image uploads to S3 successfully
‚úÖ Image URL looks like: `https://invoice-parser-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025-10-18/timestamp-filename.jpg`
‚úÖ Parser continues to OCR and extract data
‚úÖ Results display correctly
