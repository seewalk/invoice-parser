# üö® URGENT: Fix Your .env.local File to Resolve AWS Error

## Current Problem

You're getting **"SignatureDoesNotMatch"** error because your AWS credentials aren't configured correctly in your `.env.local` file.

## The Issue

Your current `.env.local` file has **NEXT_PUBLIC_** prefixes on AWS credentials. This means:
- ‚ùå Credentials are exposed to the browser (security risk)
- ‚ùå Server can't read them (server looks for `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, not `NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`)
- ‚ùå AWS signature fails because credentials aren't reaching the server action

## Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Update Your .env.local File

Open: `C:\Users\paula\invoice-parser\.env.local`

**Replace this:**
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_REGION=eu-west-2
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_S3_BUCKET=invoice-parser-images
```

**With this (REMOVE NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix):**
```env
# AWS S3 Configuration (SERVER-SIDE ONLY - NO NEXT_PUBLIC_!)
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE
AWS_REGION=eu-west-2
AWS_S3_BUCKET=invoice-parser-images

# API stays public (keep NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_ENDPOINT=https://jm1n4qxu69.execute-api.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/invoicer-stage/invoiceParser
```

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure there are NO spaces before or after the `=` signs!

### Step 2: ‚ö†Ô∏è Check Your AWS Secret Key Length

**Your actual secret key may be incorrect - it appears to be 41 characters, but AWS Secret Access Keys are ALWAYS exactly 40 characters.**

**Problem:** This suggests the key may have been copied incorrectly from AWS Console.

**This suggests:**
- You may have copied it incorrectly from AWS Console
- There might be an extra character at the end
- The key might be truncated or incomplete

**Action Required:**
1. Go to AWS Console ‚Üí IAM ‚Üí Users ‚Üí Your User ‚Üí Security Credentials
2. **Create a NEW Access Key** (don't try to view the old one - AWS doesn't show old secret keys)
3. Download the CSV file or copy BOTH keys carefully
4. Replace BOTH `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` in your `.env.local`

### Step 3: Restart Your Dev Server

**CRITICAL:** Changes to `.env.local` only take effect after restarting Next.js!

1. **Stop your current dev server:**
   - Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal running `npm run dev`

2. **Start it again:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Step 4: Test and Check Debug Logs

1. Go to http://localhost:3000/parser
2. Upload an invoice image
3. **Check the terminal/console for these debug logs:**

```
[S3 Upload] Environment check: {
  hasAccessKey: true,      ‚Üê Should be true
  hasSecretKey: true,      ‚Üê Should be true
  accessKeyLength: 20,     ‚Üê Should be exactly 20
  secretKeyLength: 40,     ‚Üê Should be exactly 40
  region: 'eu-west-2',
  bucket: 'invoice-parser-images'
}
```

**What the logs tell you:**

‚úÖ **If you see this pattern** ‚Üí Credentials are loading correctly:
- `hasAccessKey: true`
- `hasSecretKey: true`
- `accessKeyLength: 20`
- `secretKeyLength: 40`

‚ùå **If you see this** ‚Üí Env variables aren't loading:
- `hasAccessKey: false`
- `hasSecretKey: false`
- `accessKeyLength: 0`
- `secretKeyLength: 0`
‚Üí **Solution:** Restart dev server again

‚ö†Ô∏è **If you see wrong lengths** ‚Üí Keys are malformed:
- `secretKeyLength: 41` (or anything other than 40)
- `accessKeyLength: 19` (or anything other than 20)
‚Üí **Solution:** Get fresh keys from AWS Console

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. ‚ùå **Leaving NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix** ‚Üí Server can't read the credentials
2. ‚ùå **Not restarting dev server** ‚Üí Changes don't take effect
3. ‚ùå **Spaces around the = sign** ‚Üí Example: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = abc` (wrong!)
4. ‚ùå **Quotes around values** ‚Üí Don't use quotes in .env.local files
5. ‚ùå **Incomplete key copy** ‚Üí Always copy the FULL secret key from AWS

## Quick Test Without AWS (Optional)

If you want to test the parser WITHOUT fixing AWS first, the server action will automatically fall back to a demo image. But you'll see this in the console:

```
[S3 Upload] AWS credentials not configured, using fallback image
```

This lets you test the rest of the parser functionality while you fix AWS credentials.

## Still Having Issues?

After following ALL steps above, if you still get the error:

1. **Share the debug log output** from your terminal (the `[S3 Upload] Environment check:` section)
2. **Verify IAM permissions** - Your AWS user needs `s3:PutObject` permission on the `invoice-parser-images` bucket
3. **Check AWS region** - Make sure `eu-west-2` is correct for your bucket

## Expected Result

After fixing your `.env.local` and restarting:

‚úÖ Upload should succeed
‚úÖ Image URL should be: `https://invoice-parser-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/YYYY-MM-DD/timestamp-filename.jpg`
‚úÖ No more "SignatureDoesNotMatch" errors
‚úÖ Debug logs show correct credential lengths

---

**Summary of what you need to do RIGHT NOW:**

1. ‚úèÔ∏è Edit `.env.local` - Remove `NEXT_PUBLIC_` from AWS variables
2. üîë Get fresh AWS keys if your secret key isn't exactly 40 characters
3. üîÑ Restart dev server completely (`Ctrl+C` then `npm run dev`)
4. üß™ Test upload and check debug logs
5. üì¢ Report back with the debug log output

Good luck! üöÄ
